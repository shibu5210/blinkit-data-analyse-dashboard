1. Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard created on the retail and quick-commerce platform Blinkit (formerly Grofers). The purpose of this project is to analyze the business data of Blinkit and create an interactive, dynamic, and data-driven dashboard which provides valuable insights into sales, customers, products, delivery patterns, and business performance.

The dashboard was designed to address the growing need for data-driven decision making in the retail sector. With the increase in online grocery shopping, analyzing customer behavior and business operations has become a critical task.

This project leverages Power BI to visualize complex datasets in an understandable and visually appealing manner, enabling business stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and take strategic actions.

2. Problem Statement

Blinkit operates in a highly competitive online grocery delivery market. The company needs to monitor:

Sales growth and revenue trends

Product demand analysis

Customer preferences and loyalty

Delivery time performance

Regional sales comparison

Profitability across different categories

Without a proper dashboard, the data remains in spreadsheets and is difficult to interpret. Hence, this project aims to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that simplifies analysis and improves business intelligence.

3. Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this dashboard are:

To visualize sales performance across different categories and regions.

To track key business metrics such as total revenue, total orders, average order value, and number of customers.

To analyze customer purchasing behavior and identify top customers.

To find high-performing and low-performing product categories.

To measure delivery performance (on-time vs delayed deliveries).

To provide filters and slicers for better interactivity and custom analysis.

To compare sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).

To identify peak hours and days for grocery orders.

To assist stakeholders in decision making with clear KPIs.

To design a visually appealing dashboard with proper color coding and charts.

4. Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project consists of Blinkit sales data which includes the following attributes:

Order ID: Unique identifier of the order

Customer ID: Unique identifier of the customer

Order Date: Date and time when the order was placed

Delivery Time: Time taken for the order to be delivered

Product Category: Type of product (Fruits, Vegetables, Beverages, Snacks, etc.)

Product Name: Name of the product ordered

Quantity: Number of units ordered

Price: Price per unit

Total Value: Total order value

Region/City: Geographical location of the order

Payment Method: UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card, Wallet, COD, etc.

Data Cleaning Steps

Removed duplicates from the dataset.

Checked for null values and replaced them appropriately.

Standardized date and time formats.

Created calculated columns like Total Revenue = Quantity × Price.

Categorized data into different product groups.

5. Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop → For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Microsoft Excel → For initial data preprocessing.

SQL (optional) → For querying structured data (if required).

GitHub → For hosting the project files, README, and sharing with others.

6. Dashboard Features

The Blinkit Power BI Dashboard includes the following features:

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Average Order Value (AOV)

Total Customers

Profit Margin

Visualizations Used:

Bar charts for sales by category

Line charts for sales trends over time

Pie charts for payment method distribution

Donut charts for region-wise contribution

Map visuals for geographical sales

Cards for KPIs

Interactivity:

Slicers for filtering by product category, region, and time period

Drill-through pages for deeper insights

Tooltips for additional data on hover

7. Insights Derived from Dashboard

Some major insights gained from the dashboard include:

Top Performing Categories: Fresh fruits and vegetables contribute the maximum revenue.

Customer Behavior: Repeat customers form a significant share of total revenue.

Peak Order Times: Orders are highest in the evening hours (6–10 PM).

Payment Preferences: UPI and Wallet payments are the most commonly used methods.

Regional Performance: Metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore dominate sales.

Delivery Analysis: Most deliveries are completed on time, but late deliveries impact customer satisfaction.

Profitability: Beverages and packaged snacks have higher profit margins compared to staples.

8. Working Methodology

The methodology followed in this project was:

Data Collection – Gathering raw sales and order data.

Data Cleaning – Removing duplicates, handling nulls, and formatting.

Data Modeling – Creating relationships between tables in Power BI.

Measure Creation – Using DAX formulas to calculate KPIs like Revenue, AOV, Customer Retention.

Visualization – Designing different charts, maps, and cards.

Dashboard Layout – Applying a clean, user-friendly design with proper color themes.

Testing – Checking dashboard interactivity and data accuracy.

Deployment – Uploading .pbix file to GitHub repository.

9. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Missing values in delivery time data.

Solution: Filled missing values with average delivery time.

Challenge: Too many product categories making visualization complex.

Solution: Grouped categories into broader segments.

Challenge: Visual clutter due to multiple KPIs.

Solution: Used cards and KPIs in a structured layout with consistent colors.

10. Scope of the Project

Can be used by Blinkit managers to track performance in real-time.

Helps in inventory management by identifying demand patterns.

Assists marketing teams in targeting customers based on preferences.

Provides financial insights to improve profitability.

Future scope includes integration with live API data for real-time dashboards.

11. Conclusion

This Blinkit Power BI Dashboard project successfully demonstrates how data visualization can transform raw business data into meaningful insights. By using this dashboard, Blinkit and similar companies can monitor performance, improve customer satisfaction, optimize delivery, and enhance profitability.

The project also highlights the importance of data cleaning, DAX formulas, and visualization best practices in building effective dashboards.
